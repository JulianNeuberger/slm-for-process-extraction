Describe the following business process modelled in the given image in a coherent, continuous text.
Make sure it sounds natural, e.g., something found in a hand book for employees, or the notes of an employee.
I expect one or more paragraphs of text, instead of many single lines / rules in isolation.

Please follow the following guidelines:
- sequence flows between two activities should be rephrased so that the first executed activity is mentioned first
- descriptions of XOR gateways should describe the activity in which the decision occurs and then the two branches starting with 'if' or 'otherwise'
- describe the branches of decisions completely one after the other
- make sure to explicitly state if activities are executed simultaneously in an AND gateway, by using a phrase like 'and at the same time' or 'while'
