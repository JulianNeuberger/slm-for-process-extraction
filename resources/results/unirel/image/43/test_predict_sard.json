    "text": "Every time we get a new order from the sales department , first , one of my masters determines the necessary parts and quantities as well as the delivery date . Once that information is present , it has to be entered into our production planning system ( PPS ) . It optimizes our production processes and creates possibly uniform work packages so that the setup times are minimized . Besides , it creates a list of parts to be procured . Unfortunately it is not coupled correctly to our Enterprise Resource Planning system ( ERP ) , so the data must be transferred manually . By the way , that is the second step . Once all the data is present , we need to decide whether any parts are missing and must be procured or if this is not necessary . Once production is scheduled to start , we receive a notice from the system and an employee takes care of the implementation . Finally , the order will be checked again for its quality .",
