Of course , asking the customer whether he is generally interested is also important . If this is not the case , we leave him alone , except if the potential project budget is huge . Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer . If the customer is interested in the end , the next step is a detailed online presentation . It is given either by a sales representative or by a pre-sales employee in case of a more technical presentation . Afterwards we are waiting for the customer to come back to us .

    "text": "An employee purchases a product or service he requires . For instance , a sales person on a trip rents a car . The employee submits an expense report with a list of items , along with the receipts for each item . A supervisor reviews the expense report and approves or rejects the report . Since the company has expense rules , there are circumstances where the supervisor can accept or reject the report upon first inspection . These rules could be automated , to reduce the workload on the supervisor . If the supervisor rejects the report , the employee , who submitted it , is given a chance to edit it , for example to correct errors or better describe an expense . If the supervisor approves the report , it goes to the treasurer . The treasurer checks that all the receipts have been submitted and match the items on the list . If all is in order , the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing ( including , e.g . , payment or refund , and accounting ) . If receipts are missing or do not match the report , he sends it back to the employee . If a report returns to the employee for corrections , it must again go to a supervisor , even if the supervisor previously approved the report . If the treasurer accepts the expenses for processing , the report moves to an automatic activity that links to a payment system . The process waits for the payment confirmation . After the payment is confirmed , the process ends .",
