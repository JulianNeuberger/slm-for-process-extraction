    "text": "The first step is to determine contact details of potential customers . This can be achieved in several ways . Sometimes , we buy details for cold calls , sometimes , our marketing staff participates in exhibitions and sometimes , you just happen to know somebody , who is interested in the product . Then we start calling the customer . That is done by the call center staff . They are determining the contact person and the budget which would be available for the project . Of course , asking the customer whether he is generally interested is also important . If this is not the case , we leave him alone , except if the potential project budget is huge . Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer . If the customer is interested in the end , the next step is a detailed online presentation . It is given either by a sales representative or by a pre-sales employee in case of a more technical presentation . Afterwards we are waiting for the customer to come back to us . If we are not contacted within 2 weeks , a sales representative is calling the customer . The last phase is the creation of a quotation .",
