Of course , asking the customer whether he is generally interested is also important . If this is not the case , we leave him alone , except if the potential project budget is huge . Then the head of development personally tries to acquire the customer . If the customer is interested in the end , the next step is a detailed online presentation . It is given either by a sales representative or by a pre-sales employee in case of a more technical presentation . Afterwards we are waiting for the customer to come back to us .
