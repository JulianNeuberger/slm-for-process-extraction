Text\n\nSentence 0: The process is initiated by a switch-over request .\n\nSentence 1: In doing so , the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company .\n\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\n\nSentence 3: The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system .\n\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility .\n\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list .\n\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\n\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\n\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\n\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\n\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\n\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved .\n\nSentence 12: Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again .\n\nSentence 13: In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\n\nSentence 14: A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS .\n\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\n\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment .\n\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict .\n\nSentence 18: The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\n\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract .\n\nSentence 20: The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it .\n\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) .\n\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\n\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\n\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report .\n\nSentence 25: At the same time , the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier .\n\nSentence 26: Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer .\n\nSentence 27: For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then .\n\nSentence 28: After receiving the meter data

.\n\nSentence 13: If Service Management is sure they can analyze it , they perform the analysis and based on the outcome they create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem .\n\nSentence 14: After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report , it is checked whether there are any possible problems .\n\nSentence 15: If no problems are detected , a notification about the

the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\n\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\n\nSentence 24: After sending , this process path of Service Management ends .\n\nSentence 25: For the case that automatic resource restoration from Resource Provisioning is required , Service Management must create a request for automatic resource restoration .\n\nSentence 26: This message is then sent to Resource Provisioning .\n\nSentence 27: Resource Provisioning has been on-hold and waiting for a restoration request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process

problem to be not analyzable by themselves, they perform the analysis and based on the outcome create a trouble report that indicates the type of problem.\n* After Resource Provisioning receives the detailed problem report, it is checked whether there are any possible problems.\n* The process ends then after receiving the meter data from Customer Service.\n* For the case that no problem was detected at all, the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service.\n* For the case that minor corrective actions are required, Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves.\n* Subsequently, the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service.\n* After sending this process path of Service Management ends.\n* The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ).\n* Two concurrent activities are triggered, i.e. a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem, and an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing.\n* The report for the customer is sent out to her.\n* After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service.\n* After the customer then receives the report about

x^k,$$\nwhere\n$$c_k = \\sum_{\\substack{n+m=k \\\\ n> 0}} a_n a_{n-m} b_m.$$\n\\end{document}\n\n## Step 1: We are given the expression $\\left( \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n \\right) \\cdot ( \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty b_m x^m )$.\nWe can start by expanding this expression using the definition of the product of two power series.\n\n## Step 2: Expanding the given expression, we get\n$$\\left( \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n \\right) \\cdot ( \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty b_m x^m ) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty c_k x^k.$$\n\n## Step 3: To find the coefficients $c_k$, we can use the definition of the product of two power series.\nWe have\n$$\\left( \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n \\right) \\cdot ( \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty b_m x^m ) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty c_k x^k.$$\nUsing the definition of $c_k$, we get\n$$\\left( \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n \\right) \\cdot ( \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty b_m x^m ) = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( \\sum_{n+m=k} a_n a_{n-m} b_m \\right) x^k.$$\n\n## Step 4: We can simplify the expression on the right-hand side by expanding the sum over $k$.\nWe have\n$$\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( \\sum_{n+m=k} a_n a_{n-m} b_m \\right) x^k = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\sum_{n=m}^\\infty a_n a_{n-m} b_m x^k.$$\n\n## Step 5: We can simplify the expression further by using the properties of summation.\nWe have\n$$\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\sum_{n=m}^\\infty a_n a_{n-m} b_m x^k = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\left( \\sum_{n=m}^\\infty a_n a_{n-m} b_m \\right) x^k.$$\n\n## Step 6: We can simplify the expression further by using the properties of summation again.\nWe have\n$$\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\left(

the expression further by using the properties of summation again.\nWe have\n$$\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty a_m \\left( \\sum_{n=m}^\\infty a_n x^n \\right) b_m = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty a_m \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^m (a_k)^2 x^k \\right) b_m.$$\n\n## Step 9: We can simplify the expression further by using the properties of summation again.\nWe have\n$$\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty a_m \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^m (a_k)^2 x^k \\right) b_m = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty a_m \\frac{(a_0 + a_1 x + ...)(a_1 + a_2 x + ...)...}{(1+x)}b_m.$$\n\n## Step 10: We can simplify the expression further by using the properties of summation again.\nWe have\n$$\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty a_m \\frac{(a_0 + a_1 x + ...)(a_1 + a_2 x + ...)...}{(1+x)}b_m = \\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (a_0 + a_1 x + ...)(a_1 + a_2 x + ...)...(a_{m-1}+a_{m+1}x+...).$$\n\n## Step 11: We can simplify the expression further by using the properties of summation again.\nWe have\n$$\\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (a_0 + a_1 x + ...)(a_1 + a_2 x + ...)...(a_{m-1}+a_{m+1}x+...).$$\n\n## Step 12: We can simplify the expression further by using the properties of summation again.\nWe have\n$$\\frac{1}{(1-x)^2}\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty (a_0 + a_1 x + ...)(a_1 + a_2 x + ...)...(a_{m-1}+a_{m+1}x+...). = \\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n!x^n\\right)\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty k!(k-x)^{k-1}\\right).$$\n\n## Step 13: We can simplify the expression further by using the properties of summation again.\nWe have\n$$\\left(\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} n!x^n\\right)\\left(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty k!(k-x)^{k-1}\\right). = \\frac{x}{(1-x)^2}.$$\n\n## Step 14: Therefore, we have found the expression\n$$\\left( \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n \\right) \\cdot ( \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty b_m x^m ) = \\frac{x}{(1-x)^2}.$$\n\n## Step 15: The final answer is

status report and sent back to Service Management .\n\nSentence 18: Service Management then prepares the final status report based on the received information .\n\nSentence 19: Subsequently it has to be determined what counter measures should be taken depending on the information in the final status report .\n\nSentence 20: Three alternative process paths may be taken .\n\nSentence 21: For the case that no problem was detected at all , the actual service performance is sent back to the Customer Service .\n\nSentence 22: For the case that minor corrective actions are required , Service Management will undertake corrective actions by themselves .\n\nSentence 23: Subsequently , the problem resolution report is created and then sent out to Customer Service .\n\nSentence 24: After

request but this must happen within 2 days after the status report was sent out , otherwise Resource Provisioning terminates the process .\n\nSentence 28: After the restoration request is received , all possible errors are tracked .\n\nSentence 29: Based on the tracked errors , all necessary corrective actions are undertaken by Resource Provisioning .\n\nSentence 30: Then a trouble-shooting report is created .\n\nSentence 31: This report is sent out to Service Management ; then the process ends .\n\nSentence 32: The trouble-shooting report is received by Service Management and this information goes then into the creation of the problem resolution report just as described for ii ) .\n\nSentence 33: Customer Service either receives the actual service performance ( if there was no problem ) or the problem resolution report .\n\nSentence 34: Then , two concurrent activities are triggered , i.e . i ) a report is created for the customer which details the current service performance and the resolution of the problem , and ii ) an SLA violation rebate is reported to Billing & Collections who will adjust the billing .\n\nSentence 35: The report for the customer is sent out to her .\n\nSentence 36: After all three activities are completed the process ends within Customer Service .\n\nSentence 37: After the customer then receives the report about service performance

1: In doing so , the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company .\n\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\n\nSentence 3: The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system .\n\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility .\n\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list .\n\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\n\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\n\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\n\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\n\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\n\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved .\n\nSentence 12: Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again .\n\nSentence 13: In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\n\nSentence 14: A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS .\n\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\n\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment .\n\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict .\n\nSentence 18: The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\n\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract .\n\nSentence 20: The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it .\n\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) .\n\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\n\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\n\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report .\n\nSentence 25: At the same time , the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier .\n\nSentence 26: Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer .\n\nSentence 27: For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then .\n\nSentence 28: After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information .\n\nSentence 29: The process of winning a new customer ends here .\n", "System: # Task Description\n\nYou are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying mentions of process relevant

received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is <activity> entered </activity> into the CRM system .\n\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be <activity> compared </activity> with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility .\n\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list .\n\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\n\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\n\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\n\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\n\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\n\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved .\n\nSentence 12: Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again .\n\nSentence 13: In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\n\nSentence 14: A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS .\n\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\n\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment .\n\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict .\n\nSentence 18: The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\n\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract .\n\nSentence 20: The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it .\n\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) .\n\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\n\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\n\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report .\n\nSentence 25: At the same time , the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier .\n\nSentence 26: Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer .\n\nSentence 27: For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then .\n\nSentence 28: After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information .\n\nSentence 29: The process of winning a new customer ends here .\n", "System: # Task Description\n\nYou are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying specifications of how activity execution in

Text\n\nSentence 0: The process is initiated by a switch-over request .\n\nSentence 1: In doing so , the customer transmits his data to the customer service department of the company .\n\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\n\nSentence 3: The customer data is received by customer service and based on this data a customer data object is entered into the CRM system .\n\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered it should then be compared with the internal customer data base and checked for completeness and plausibility .\n\nSentence 5: In case of any errors these should be corrected on the basis of a simple error list .\n\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\n\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , a new customer object is being created which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\n\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\n\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to prepare the contract documents for the power supplier switch ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\n\nSentence 10: In the following an automated check of the contract documents is carried out within the CIS ( customer information system ) in order to confirm their successful generation .\n\nSentence 11: In case of a negative response , i.e . the contract documents are not ( or incorrectly ) generated , the causing issues are being analyzed and resolved .\n\nSentence 12: Subsequently the contract documents are generated once again .\n\nSentence 13: In case of a positive response a confirmation document is sent out to the customer stating that the switch-over to the new supplier can be executed .\n\nSentence 14: A request to the grid operator is automatically sent out by the CIS .\n\nSentence 15: It puts the question whether the customer may be supplied by the selected supplier in the future .\n\nSentence 16: The switch-over request is checked by the grid operator for supplier concurrence , and the grid operator transmits a response comment .\n\nSentence 17: In the case of supplier concurrence the grid operator would inform all involved suppliers and demand the resolution of the conflict .\n\nSentence 18: The grid operator communicates with the old supplier and carries out the termination of the sales agreement between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to interact with the old supplier regarding termination ) .\n\nSentence 19: If there are not any objections by the grid operator ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , customer service creates a CIS contract .\n\nSentence 20: The customer then has the chance to check the contract details and based on this check may decide to either withdraw from the switch contract or confirm it .\n\nSentence 21: Depending on the customer's acceptance / rejection the process flow at customer service either ends ( in case of withdrawal ) or continues ( in case of a confirmation ) .\n\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\n\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\n\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , the grid operator transmits the power meter data to the customer service and the old supplier via messages containing a services consumption report .\n\nSentence 25: At the same time , the grid operator computes the final billing based on the meter data and sends it to the old supplier .\n\nSentence 26: Likewise the old supplier creates and sends the final billing to the customer .\n\nSentence 27: For the customer as well as the grid operator the process ends then .\n\nSentence 28: After receiving the meter data customer service imports the meter data to systems that require the information .\n\nSentence 29: The process of winning a new customer ends here .\n\nAI:

You can use those for additional context.\n\n# Definition\n\n**XOR Gateway**: Identify decision points in the process, i.e. exclusive work streams, usually indicated by conjunctions or adverbs. Extract only the trigger word, not the text following it. A conjunction or adverb is only a XOR Gateway, if it introduces two mutually exclusive actions i.e. a later sentence contains the description of the second work stream, e.g., indicated by an accompanying \"otherwise\".\n\n# Format\n\nFor each mention you detect, write a line in the following format:\n\n<text>\tXOR Gateway\t<sentence>\n\n## Placeholders\n\n- <text>: the text of the mention\n- <sentence>: integer, that identifies the sentence where the mention text was found in the input.

</activity_data> should be <activity> corrected </activity> on the basis of a simple error list .\n\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\n\nSentence 7: In case the customer does not exist in the customer data base , <activity_data> a new customer object </activity_data> is being <activity> created </activity> which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\n\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\n\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to <activity> prepare </activity> <activity_data> the contract documents for the power supplier

after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\n\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\n\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , <actor> the grid

</activity_data> to <actor> the customer service department </actor> of the company .\n\nSentence 2: Customer service is a shared service center between the departments Sales and Distribution .\n\nSentence 3: <activity_data> The customer data </activity_data> is <activity> received </activity> by <actor> customer service </actor> and based on this data <activity_data> a customer data object </activity_data> is <activity> entered </activity> <further_specification> into the CRM system </further_specification> .\n\nSentence 4: After customer data has been entered <activity_data> it </activity_data> should then be <activity> compared </activity> with <activity_data> the internal customer data base </activity_data> and <activity> checked </activity> <further_specification> for

</activity_data> should be <activity> corrected </activity> on the basis of a simple error list .\n\nSentence 6: The comparison of data is done to prevent individual customer data being stored multiple times .\n\nSentence 7: <xor_gateway> In case </xor_gateway> <condition_specification> the customer does not exist in the customer data base </condition_specification> , <activity_data> a new customer object </activity_data> is being <activity> created </activity> which will remain the data object of interest during the rest of the process flow .\n\nSentence 8: This object consists of data elements such as the customer's name and address and the assigned power gauge .\n\nSentence 9: The generated customer object is then used , in combination with other customer data to <activity> prepare </activity> <activity_data> the contract documents for the power supplier switch </activity_data> ( including data such as bank connection , information on the selected rate , requested date of switch-over ) .\n\nSentence 10: In the following an automated <activity> check </activity> of <activity_data> the contract documents </activity_data> is carried out within <actor> the CIS </actor>

concurrence </condition_specification> <actor> the grid operator </actor> would <activity> inform </activity> <actor> all involved suppliers </actor> and <activity> demand </activity> <activity_data> the resolution of the conflict </activity_data> .\n\nSentence 18: <actor> The grid operator </actor> <activity> communicates </activity> with <actor> the old supplier </actor> and <activity> carries out </activity> <activity_data> the termination of the sales agreement </activity_data> between the customer and the old supplier ( i.e . the customer service ( of the new supplier ) does not have to

</condition_specification> ( i.e . no supplier concurrence ) , <actor> customer service </actor> <activity> creates </activity> <activity_data> a CIS contract </activity_data> .\n\nSentence 20:

confirmation ) .\n\nSentence 22: An additional constraint is that the customer can only withdraw from the offered contract within 7 days after the 7th day the contract will be regarded as accepted and the process continues .\n\nSentence 23: The confirmation message by the customer is therefore not absolutely necessary ( as it will count as accepted after 7 days in any way ) but it can speed up the switch process .\n\nSentence 24: On the switch-date , but no later than 10 days after power supply has begun , <actor> the grid operator </actor> <activity> transmits </activity> <activity_data> the power meter data </activity_data> to <actor> the customer service </actor> and <actor> the old supplier </actor> <further_specification> via messages containing a services consumption report
