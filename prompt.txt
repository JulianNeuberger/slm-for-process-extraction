# Task

You are a business process modelling expert, tasked with identifying relations between mentions of business process relevant facts in textual descriptions of business processes.
These mentions have a type and are marked in the given text by xml-style tags, which includes an id, you can use to refer to it.

# Relation Types

Relations are directed and therefore have a source mention and a target mention. Additionally, they have one of the types described below.

- **uses**: Focus on mentions of type "activity". Find the "activity_data" mention, that is being used or created during the execution of this activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type "uses". The source mention is the activity, the target mention is the "activity_data" mention.

- **flow**: Focus on mentions of types "Activity", "XOR_Gateway", "AND_Gateway", and "Condition_Specification". If a condition_specification follows an XOR_Gateway connect the XOR_Gateway (source) to the Condition_Specification (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, or AND_Gateway follows an Activity, connect the one appearing earlier (head) with the latter one (target). If an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition_Specification follows an Activity, XOR_Gateway, AND_Gateway, or Condition Specification, connect the earlier one (source) to the latter one (target).

- **actor performer**: Focus on mentions of type "activity" and look for the "actor", that actively performs the activity (not is passively affected by it!). If you find one, extract a relation of type "actor performer". The source mention is the "activity", and the target mention is the "actor".

- **actor recipient**: Focus on mentions of type "activity" and look for the "actor", that receives the result of some activity execution, i.e., they are passively affected by the activity. If you find one, extract a relation of type "actor recipient". The source mention is the "Activity", the target mention is the "Actor".

- **same gateway**: Textual descriptions of gateways are often spread over several phrases, especially the different outgoing paths, this relation links these disjointed descriptions together. Look for elements of type "xor_gateway" and "and_gateway". If you find another mention of the same type, check if they describe the same decision point in the process execution. If they do, extract a relation of type "same gateway", with the source mention being the one that appears earlier in the text, and the target mention being the one that appears later.

- **further specification**: Focus on mentions of type "activity". Try and find mentions of type "further_specification", that describe how this activity has to be executed, or describe the activity further. If you find one, extract a relation of type "further_specification", where the source mention is the activity and the target mention is the mention of type "further_specification".

# Format

Retrieve a relation by listing the relation type, the head mention index, and the tail mention index, separated by tabs. List one relation per line.

<relation-type>	<source-mention-index>	<target-mention-index>

## Format Examples

Given the following input:

the <actor id=1> LLM </actor> <activity id=0> extracts </activity> <activity_data id=2> the text </activity> .

You will extract these relations

actor performer	0	1
uses	0	2

# Restrictions

Rule 1. Only extract relations with types, that are defined in chapter **Relation Types**.

Reference the following SBVR (vocabulary and rules) for your task.
Note, that activities in PET are just the action (verb) and data objects are the object that is used in the activity, connected via a Uses relation.
In SBVR the task label is put into the vocabulary, which is usually both the action and the data object, or the (receiving) actor.

Task labels and actors in the process:

EPV airport
control tower operator
de-icing department
coordinator
iceman
controller
Confirm the plane details
Put plane in queue
Allow the plane to start
Put plane in queue de-icing
Do necessary paperwork
Check information
use 2-step de-icing
Add details about procedure to plane information
use  1-step de-icing
Check information about plane
Check the plane

Business rules are:

It is obligatory that control tower operator Confirm the plane details after the process starts
control tower operator Confirm the plane details
It is obligatory that iceman Check information after coordinator Put plane in queue de-icing
It is obligatory that coordinator Do necessary paperwork after coordinator Put plane in queue de-icing
coordinator Put plane in queue de-icing
control tower operator Put plane in queue
It is obligatory that either iceman use  1-step de-icing in case 1-step or iceman use 2-step de-icing in case 2-step but only one after iceman Check information
iceman Check information
It is obligatory that the process ends after control tower operator Allow the plane to start
It is obligatory that iceman Add details about procedure to plane information after either
It is obligatory that controller Check information about plane after iceman Add details about procedure to plane information
It is obligatory that controller Check the plane after controller Check information about plane
controller Check information about plane

The text is as follows

The process begins when the <actor id=0> control tower operator </actor> <activity id=1> confirms </activity> <activity_data id=2> the plane details </activity_data> after the process starts .  First , <actor id=3> the control tower operator </actor> <activity id=4> confirms </activity> <activity_data id=5> the plane details </activity_data> .  Next , <actor id=6> the iceman </actor> <activity id=7> checks </activity> <activity_data id=8> information </activity_data> after the <actor id=9> coordinator </actor> <activity id=10> puts </activity> <activity_data id=11> the plane </activity_data> in the queue for de - icing .  At the same time , the <actor id=12> coordinator </actor> <activity id=13> does </activity> <activity_data id=14> the necessary paperwork </activity_data> after putting the plane in <activity_data id=15> the de - icing queue </activity_data> .  <actor id=16> The coordinator </actor> <activity id=17> puts </activity> <activity_data id=18> the plane </activity_data> in the de - icing queue .  <actor id=19> The control tower operator </actor> <activity id=20> puts </activity> <activity_data id=21> the plane </activity_data> in the queue .  If the <actor id=27> <actor id=22> </actor> iceman </actor> <activity id=30> <activity id=25> </activity> uses </activity> 1 - step de - icing in case 1 - step , then the <actor id=28> <actor id=23> </actor> iceman </actor> <activity id=31> <activity id=26> </activity> uses </activity> 2 - step de - icing in case 2 - step , but only one option is used after the <actor id=29> <actor id=24> </actor> iceman </actor> checks information .  If the <actor id=32> iceman </actor> <activity id=33> checks </activity> <activity_data id=34> information </activity_data> , then the process continues with the appropriate de - icing option selected .  <activity id=35> The process ends </activity> after the <actor id=36> control tower operator </actor> <activity id=37> allows </activity> <activity_data id=38> the plane </activity_data> to start .  Additionally , the <actor id=39> iceman </actor> <activity id=40> adds </activity> <activity_data id=41> details about the procedure to the plane information </activity_data> after either de - icing option is chosen .  The <actor id=42> controller </actor> <activity id=43> checks </activity> <activity_data id=44> information about the plane </activity_data> after the iceman adds details about the procedure to the plane information .  The <actor id=45> controller </actor> <activity id=47> checks </activity> <activity_data id=49> the information about the plane </activity_data> after the <actor id=46> controller </actor> <activity id=48> checks </activity> information about the plane .  Finally , the <actor id=50> controller </actor> <activity id=51> checks </activity> <activity_data id=52> the information about the plane </activity_data> .
